        <h1>What we do</h1>
        <p><span class="key-word">InsidAR</span> let's you locate yourself in a <b>previously scanned</b>, <b>indoor</b> setting, using just your <b>mobile camera</b> and no other external assets, based on <b>computer vision</b> solutions.
           <br/> All you have to do is <b>(1) open your mobile camera</b>, <b> (2) scan around</b> for a couple of seconds and then start navigating in a <b>(3) GPS-like manner</b>.
        </p>

        <div class="steps-explanation">
            <img src="./img/2_1.jpg">
            <img src="./img/2_2.jpg">
            <img src="./img/2_3.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>What does <span class="red">'Previously Scanned'</span> mean?</h2>
        <p>For the main user the workflow is easy, as explained before. You can see our algorithm working with the information from the camera as a "human eye" trying to remember if he had been to a building.
            For this, we need to have on the server a scan of the building we are working with. This means we need to create a map containing all the RGB data and also some 3D scanned points and override it over your map of the building.
            But don't worry. We are here to support you in this and do <b>all this work for you</b>!
        </p>

        <!-- <div class="centered-image"><img src="./img/3.jpg"/></div> -->
        <h2>Why <span class="red">vision-based</span> ?</h2> 
        <p>
            There are of course other solutions, but the X-spot we're in is the Sweet Spot between <b>accesibility</b> and <b>afforable</b> you might just need!
        </p>
        <p><b>Accesibility</b> - You don't need any extra asset! Of course, you still need for someone to scan the building and a cool dashboard to setup the map. But no extra images sticked all over your building, no hidden, thousands of beacons with limited battery, and no custom trackers to give to your clients so they feel tracked. </p>
        <p><b>Affordable</b> - Of course there are more powerful devices. But your clients might not have the budget or interest to buy a cutting-edge Mixed Reality headset. We love those too, but we understand that, for now, smartphones are still the only mobile mainstream device. So all they need is one app, they can find on App Store or Google Play!</p>

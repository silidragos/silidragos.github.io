                <p>
                    ArtLink is a solution tailored for the COVID-19 cultural crisis, and aims to help visual artists,
                    museums and galleries keep in touch with their public through Augmentes Reality, by offering you the
                    possibility to explore high resolution art exhibitions from the safety of your own home. Our mission
                    is to make art acessible anytime anywhere, and reach communities who have little or no access to
                    cultural institutions.

                    <h3>1.The Problem</h3>
                    <p>ArtLink addresses the needs of the very challenged cultural and performing arts sector. Artists,
                        galleries, museums, are all suffering financially because of COVID-19 restrictions, while their
                        public find it really difficult to get in touch with their exhibits. The lockdown caused 90% of
                        the
                        art institutions to close, some of which will never reopen again. This caused the art market
                        sales
                        to drop by 23 bilion and many people to lose their jobs. </p>

                    <img class="main" src="./img/Vision.png" />
                    <h3>2.The Vision</h3>
                    <p>With the help of augmented reality, wețre currently ammassing an online virtual gallery which
                        strives
                        to gather as many young artists and cultural institutions as possibile in an effort of building
                        a
                        bridge between artists, museums, galleries and their public. Hence the nameȘ ArtLink, and our
                        motto:
                        The Art World at your fingertips.</p>

                    <img class="main" src="./img/Mission.png" />
                    <h3>3.The Mission</h3>
                    <p>To democratize access to visual arts and bring galleries and museums closer to people, and at the
                        same time, bring people from any corner of the world and any walk of life closer to art and
                        culture.
